# My AutoHotKey scripts
AutoHotKey scripts I use for quality of life improvements and mouse issues.

You'll have to customize some of these.

- **audio_switch.ahk**: switch between monitor speakers and headphones pressing 1 key (Scroll Lock) (need [NirCmd](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/nircmd.html) installed and in Path). Shows an icon with the audio output device in taskbar.

- **edge_url_incognito.ahk**: open an URL in clipboard in Edge in incognito pressing 1 key (Pause).

- **left_click.ahk**: left click in my mouse stopped working today so I remapped it to Esc.

- **mouse_back_fix.ahk**: back button in my mouse sometimes does double click and it's annoying. This script fixes that.

- **mousewheel_button.ahk**: middle button (wheel click) doesn't work in my mouse so I remapped it to Caps Lock.

- **mpv_video.ahk**: open any video, URL or path in mpv. Uses yt-dlp so it works with Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, etc.

- **spotify_stop.ahk**: stops Spotify when song ends if I press the Launch Media Player key. Spotify window has to be open for this to work.
